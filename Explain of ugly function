Ugly example (GodAccount) â€” functions & definitions

1. deposit_and_print(self)

Purpose: reads user input, updates a global balance, prints result.

Problems: direct I/O inside the method (hard to unit test); using global variable GLOBAL_BALANCE (makes behavior depend on external state); no validation; side effects and poor separation of concerns.



2. withdraw_and_print(self)

Same problems as above, but for withdrawal.
